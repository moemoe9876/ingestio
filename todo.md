## 1 Need update pdf viewer for multipage pdf documents, currently throwing up errors when uploaded 

## 2 Need to update and improve the page/ docs logic, how should we count a document with multi pages in respects to the usage tier for user and our backend logic. Currently all documents are process as 1 page regradless of page count.
