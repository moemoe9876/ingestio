## 1 Need update pdf viewer for multipage pdf documents, currently throwing up errors when uploaded 

## 2 Need to update and improve the page/ docs logic, how should we count a document with multi pages in respects to the usage tier for user and our backend logic. Currently all documents are process as 1 page regradless of page count. 

## Remove the bounding boxed data when users export their data in json format and maybe provide option to include include bounding boxes data. 

## When a user hovers on the extracted data panel for a period of time, there will be an animation or effect where that data will be highlighted in the document preview section where it will dynamically go to that data point where it was extracted from the document. We kind of have some code set up right now but it's not working properly so we need to fix that and update that logic.

## most recent document (1 hour old) doesn't appear after a manual refresh in history page recently processed, the issue might lie deeper, potentially in backend caching, database delays, or the fetchUserDocumentsAction implementation itself

## improve metrics page !!
