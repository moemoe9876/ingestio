# Batch Processing Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive batch document processing system allowing Plus and Growth tier subscribers to upload multiple documents at once. The implementation includes a user-friendly file upload interface with drag-and-drop support, robust server-side validation, and a database structure for tracking batch processes.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Batch Upload UI
- **File:** `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/batch-upload/page.tsx`
- **Description:** Main batch upload page with subscription tier validation and user guidance
- **Key Features:**
  - Subscription tier checks (Plus/Growth only)
  - Clear user instructions and limits based on tier
  - Integration with the multi-file uploader component

### 2. Multi-File Uploader Component
- **File:** `components/utilities/BatchFileUpload.tsx`
- **Description:** Reusable component for handling multiple file uploads
- **Key Features:**
  - Drag-and-drop interface with React Dropzone
  - File validation (type, size, number)
  - Visual feedback for selected files
  - Client-side validation before submission

### 3. Database Schema for Batch Processes
- **File:** `db/schema/batch-processes-schema.ts`
- **Description:** Database structure for tracking batch uploads and their processing status
- **Key Features:**
  - Tracking batch status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
  - Linking batches to specific users
  - Metadata for timestamps and processing details

### 4. Batch Creation Server Action
- **File:** `actions/batch/batchActions.ts`
- **Description:** Server-side action for processing batch uploads
- **Key Features:**
  - Secure server-side validation
  - Transaction-based batch creation
  - File upload handling
  - Document record creation for each file
  - User quota management

## Testing Conducted
- Verified subscription tier validation redirects non-eligible users
- Tested file selection with various file types and sizes
- Confirmed proper validation messages for invalid selections
- Verified database records are created correctly for batches
- Tested batch limits based on subscription tiers

## Next Steps
- Implement background processing using Vercel Cron Jobs (Task 8.3)
- Create batch history view for users to monitor processing status
- Add detailed status view for individual batches
- Implement export functionality for processed batches
